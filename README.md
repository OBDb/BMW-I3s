## About BMW i3s

The BMW i3s is the sportier variant of BMW's innovative i3 electric vehicle, featuring enhanced performance characteristics and sport-oriented styling compared to the standard i3 model.

## Generations

- **First Generation (2018-2022)**: Introduced as a sportier version of the existing BMW i3, the i3s featured a more powerful electric motor producing 184 hp (compared to the standard i3's 170 hp), sport suspension with a 10mm lower ride height, wider track, and 20-inch wheels. The i3s boasted improved acceleration (0-60 mph in approximately 6.8 seconds) and a sportier driving character. Like the standard i3, it was available with an optional range extender (REx) - a small gasoline engine that functioned as a generator to charge the battery. The i3s featured distinctive design elements including wider wheel arches, unique bumpers, and exclusive color options to differentiate it from the standard i3.

- **Final Edition (2022-2023)**: For its final production years, BMW released special editions of the i3s with unique trim options and styling elements. Performance specifications remained largely unchanged from the first generation, but these models included updated technology features and exclusive design elements to mark the end of the i3 lineup before BMW's transition to its next generation of electric vehicles.
